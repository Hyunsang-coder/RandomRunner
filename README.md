“Random Runner” is a light-hearted, fast-paced 3D mini-game where six quirky characters — like a ninja, wizard, and viking — dash to the finish line in a race driven entirely by chance.

Each run is packed with unpredictable twists: characters might stumble out of nowhere or suddenly activate speed boosts that shake up the rankings. There’s no player control — the fun lies in watching the chaos unfold. It’s the perfect tool for settling bets, picking turn order, or just enjoying a few seconds of hilarious randomness.

Whether you’re deciding who buys the next round or simply want a quick dose of entertainment, Random Runner makes every race a wild and laugh-filled ride.
